# Rando

A small collection of functions and mixins to help you make the most out of Sass's built-in `random()` function.

Want to not think about preserving units when you're randomizing? Need to shuffle to a list? Want to roll 2d6 in Sass? Rando might be useful for you; it aims to make otherwise-complicated randomization-related tasks simple to implement.

## How To Install

`npm install rando`, `git clone`, or simply copy-and-paste the contents of the `sass/` folder.
